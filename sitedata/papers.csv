In this paper we propose BART-fusion, a novel model for generating lyrics interpretations from lyrics and music audio that combines a large-scale pre-trained language model with an audio encoder. We employ a cross-modal attention module to incorporate the audio representation into the lyrics representation to help the pre-trained language model understand the song from an audio perspective, while preserving the language model's original generative performance. We also release the Song Interpretation Dataset, a new large-scale dataset for training and evaluating our model.

This paper presents an audio retrieval system that generates noise and reverberation robust audio fingerprints using the contrastive learning framework. Using these fingerprints, the method performs a comprehensive search to identify the query audio and precisely estimate its timestamp in the reference audio. Our framework involves training a CNN to maximize the similarity between pairs of embeddings extracted from clean audio and its corresponding distorted and time-shifted version. We employ a channel-wise spectral-temporal attention mechanism to capture salient time indices and spectral bands in the CNN features. The attention mechanism enables the CNN to better discriminate the audio by giving more weight to the salient spectral-temporal patches in the signal.

109,,1,1,6,"In-person, in Bengaluru",FALSE,Tailed U-Net: Multi-Scale Music Representation Learning,"Self-supervised learning has steadily been gaining traction in recent years. In music information retrieval (MIR), one promising recent application of self-supervised learning is the CLMR framework (contrastive learning of musical representations). CLMR has shown good performance, achieving results on par with state-of-the-art end-to-end classification models, but it is strictly an encoding framework. It suffers the characteristic limitation of any encoder that it cannot explicitly combine multi-timescale information, whereas a characteristic feature of human audio perception is that we tend to perceive all frequencies simultaneously. To this end, we propose a generalization of CLMR that learns to extract and explicitly combine representations across different frequency resolutions, which we coin the tailed U-Net (TUNe). TUNe architectures combine multi-timescale information during a decoding phase, similar to U-Net architectures used in computer vision and source separation, but have a tail added to reduce sample-level information to a smaller pre-defined number of representation dimensions. The size of the decoding phase is a hyperparameter, and in the case of a zero-layer decoding phase, TUNe reduces to CLMR. The best TUNe architectures, however, require less training time to match CLMR performance, have superior transfer learning performance, and are competitive with state-of-the-art models even at dramatically reduced dimensionalities.

SawSing synthesizes the harmonic part of singing voices by filtering a sawtooth source signal with a linear time-variant finite impulse response filter whose coefficients are estimated from the input mel-spectrogram by a neural network. As this approach enforces phase continuity, SawSing can generate singing voices without the phase-discontinuity glitch of many existing vocoders. Moreover, the source-filter assumption provides an inductive bias that allows SawSing to be trained on a small amount of data.

Contrastive methods are a popular choice for self-supervision in the audio domain, and typically provide a learning signal by forcing the model to be invariant to some transformations of the input. These methods, however, require measures such as negative sampling or some form of regularisation to be taken to prevent the model from collapsing on trivial solutions. 
In this work, instead of invariance, we propose to use equivariance as a self-supervision signal to learn audio tempo representations from unlabelled data. We derive a simple loss function that prevents the network from collapsing on a trivial solution during training, without requiring any form of regularisation or negative sampling.
Our experiments show that it is possible to learn meaningful representations for tempo estimation by solely relying on equivariant self-supervision, achieving performance comparable with supervised methods on several benchmarks.

The work of twelve-tone composers is famously challenging to traditional Western tonal and structural sensibilities; even so, group theoretic approaches have determined that 10% of certain composers’ works contain a highly unusual classical symmetry of music. We extend this result by revealing many symmetries that were previously undetected in the works of Schoenberg, Webern, and Berg. Our approach is computational rather than group theoretic, scanning each composition for symmetries of many different cardinalities. Thus, we capture partial symmetries that would be overlooked by more formal means. Moreover, our methods are applicable beyond the narrow scope of twelve-tone composition. We achieve our results by first extending the group-theoretic notion of symmetry to encompass shorter motives that may be repeated and reprised in a given composition, and then comparing the incidence of these symmetries between the work of composers and the space of all possible 12-tone rows.

Recent work suggests that musical surprisal, that is, the unexpectedness of a musical event given its context, may directly predict listeners’ experiences of pleasure and enjoyment during music listening. Understanding how surprisal shapes listeners’ preferences for certain musical pieces has implications for music recommender systems, which are typically content- (both acoustic or semantic) or metadata-based. Here we test a recently developed computational algorithm, called Dynamic-Regularity Extraction (D-REX), that uses Bayesian inference to predict the surprisal that humans experience while listening to music. We demonstrate that the brain tracks musical surprisal as modeled by D-REX by conducting a decoding analysis on the neural signal (collected through magnetoencephalography) of participants listening to music.

Modern speech generation pipelines use a vocoder as their final component. Recent vocoder models developed for speech achieve high degree of realism, such that it is natural to wonder how they would perform on music signals. Compared to speech, the heterogeneity and structure of the musical sound texture offers new challenges. In this work we focus on one specific artifact that some vocoder models designed for speech tend to exhibit when applied to music: the perceived instability of pitch when synthesizing sustained notes. We argue that the characteristic sound of this artifact is due to the lack of horizontal phase coherence, which is often the result of using a time-domain target space with a model that is invariant to time-shifts, such as a convolutional neural network. 

We propose a new vocoder model that is specifically designed for music. Key to improving the pitch stability is the choice of a shift-invariant target space that consists of the magnitude spectrum and the phase gradient.

Using Top100 charts from these countries, we constructed a network based on the co-occurrence of songs in charts, and used eigencentrality as an indicator of cross-cultural song popularity. We then compared the country-of-origin of the artists, arousal music features, and socioeconomic indicators. Songs from artists with Anglo-American backgrounds tended to have higher eigencentrality overall, and mixed effects regressions showed that eigencentrality was negatively associated with danceability, and positively associated with spectral energy, and the migrant population of the country (of the charts). Next, using community detection, we observed 11 separate 'communities' in the network. Most communities appeared to be limited by region/culture, but Anglo-American music seemed disproportionally able to transcend cultural boundaries far beyond their geographical borders.

In this paper, I show that the performance of genre classifiers fluctuates as genres evolve. Unsatisfactory performance of the classifiers may not indicate algorithmic flaws but rather the change of genre characteristics. I demonstrate this by studying the case of Chinese Hip-Hop music. Specifically, I collected and analyzed 69,427 songs from four genres (Hip-Hop, Pop, Rock, and Folk) released on a Chinese music platform between 2009 and 2019. Using classifiers trained from the songs in different year cohorts to predict the genre of all the songs, I show how genre classifiers can be used to detect the stylistic shift in Hip-Hop that happened during this period. The paper thus offers a novel, sociological perspective on contending with the much-challenged idea of improving genre classification accuracy for its own sake.

In this paper, we adapt concept learning to the realm of music, with its particularities. For instance, music concepts are typically non-independent and of mixed nature (e.g. genre, instruments, mood), unlike previous work that assumed disentangled concepts.
We propose a method to learn numerous music concepts from audio and then automatically hierarchise them to expose their mutual relationships.

However, the improvement is marginal when training the ALT system directly with ASR data, because of the gap between the singing voice and standard speech data which is rooted in music-specific acoustic characteristics in singing voice. In this paper, we propose PDAugment, a data augmentation method that adjusts pitch and duration of speech at syllable level under the guidance of music scores to help ALT training. Specifically, we adjust the pitch and duration of each syllable in natural speech to those of the corresponding note extracted from music scores, to narrow the gap between natural speech and singing voice.

In this study, we investigate the stability of feature group importance when different classification methods and different measures of classification quality are applied. Since musical scores are particularly helpful in deriving semantically meaningful, robust genre characteristics, we focus on the feature groups analyzed by the jSymbolic feature extraction software, which describe properties associated with instrumentation, basic pitch statistics, melody, chords, tempo, and other rhythmic aspects. These symbolic features are analyzed in the context of musical information drawn from five other modalities, and experiments are conducted involving two datasets, one small and one large. The results show that, although some feature groups can remain similarly important compared to others, differences can also be evident in various applications, and can depend on the particular classifier and evaluation measure being used.

This problem is referred to as domain shift and is commonly approached using domain adaptation (DA) methods. As one relevant scenario, automatic piano transcription algorithms in music learning applications potentially suffer from domain shift since pianos are recorded in different acoustic conditions using various devices. Yet, most currently available datasets for piano transcription only cover ideal recording situations with high-quality microphones.
 Consequently, a transcription model trained on these datasets will face a mismatch between source and target data in real-world scenarios.
 To address this issue, we employ a recently proposed dataset which includes annotated piano recordings covering typical real-life recording settings for a piano learning application on mobile devices.
 We first quantify the influence of the domain shift on the performance of a deep learning-based piano multi-pitch estimation (MPE) algorithm.

For training supervised machine learning models such as DNNs, isolated sources are required. In the case of popular music, one can exploit open-source datasets which involve multitrack recordings of vocals, bass, and drums. For western classical music, however, isolated sources are generally not available. In this article, we consider the case of piano concertos, which are composed for a pianist typically accompanied by an orchestra. The lack of multitrack recordings makes training supervised machine learning models for the separation of piano and orchestra challenging.

The domain adaptation approach has thus recently been taken for updating an ASR model pre-trained from sufficient speech data. In the naive application of the end-to-end approach to ALT, the internal audio-to-lyrics alignment often fails due to the time-stretching nature of singing features. To stabilize the alignment, we make use of the semi-synchronous relationships between notes and characters. Specifically, a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) is used for estimating the semitone-level pitches with note onset times while eliminating the intra- and inter-note pitch variations.

To address this problem, we propose a CNN-Transformer-based MTI model designed to robustly identify a single melody track for a given MIDI file.

Therefore, we pose the hypothesis that features extracted from different parts of the lyrics can have significantly different predictive power. To test this hypothesis, we perform a series of experiments to determine whether models trained on features taken from verses and choruses perform differently for genre recognition. Our experiments indeed confirm our hypothesis, showing that generally, using features extracted from verses leads to higher performance than features extracted from choruses.

Dataset curation cannot be crowdsourced; one needs trained musicians to devote sizable effort to carry out such annotations. Further, such an analysis is not simple for beginners; obtaining labeled data that can capture the nuances of a musician's reasoning acquired over years of practice is fraught with challenges. To this end, we provide a system for computational analysis of classical music, both for machine learning and music researchers.

However, automatic cadence detection remains a challenging task mainly because it involves a combination of high-level musical elements like harmony, voice leading, and rhythm. In this work, we present a graph representation of symbolic scores as an intermediate means to solve the cadence detection task. We approach cadence detection as an imbalanced node classification problem using a Graph Convolutional Network. We obtain results that are at least on par with the state of the art, and we present a model capable of making predictions at multiple levels of granularity, from individual notes to beats, thanks to the fine-grained, note-by-note representation. Moreover, our experiments suggest that graph convolution is able to learn non-local features that assist in cadence detection, freeing us from the need of having to devise specialized features that encode non-local context.

A straightforward way is to control a model using different conditions during inference. However, in music practice, conditions are usually sequential (rather than simple categorical labels), involving rich information that overlaps with the learned representation. Consequently, the decoder gets confused about whether to ""listen to"" the latent representation or the condition, and sometimes just ignores the condition. To solve this problem, we leverage domain adversarial training to disentangle the representation from condition cues for better control. Specifically, we propose a condition corruption objective that uses the representation to denoise a corrupted condition. Minimized by a discriminator and maximized by the VAE encoder, this objective adversarially induces a condition-invariant representation.
